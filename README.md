# test_boot
-just a code made in flutter to make the application start automatically.
-this works when the android OS device reboots.
-another way it works is when the android device is turned off and then turned on.
-If you are going to use this code, it is suggested to try with the Android device, it may not work with certain versions of that operating system.
